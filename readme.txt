Hey Everyone ! Anukalp Varshney This Side...

Once At All Everyone Face The Problem Where Some Of Important Key / Shortcut Keys Don't Work On Our System. Its Too Frustating Right. We Have To Use A Keymapping Software But We Can't Find A Good One Or If We Find It Is Paid.

I (An Programmer) Solved This Problem And Made A Simple, Free, Seemless Keymapping Software Using Basic Python Language Functions And Also Added Preset Functions To Save Your Time. It Can Work On Any PC.

But Before Using It You Have To Install Some Libraries Of Python In Your System Which I Have Listed In The "Requirements" Word File.

After Installing Those Two Small Libraries Just Run The Executable (.exe) File.

Enjoy!!
